# Why Online Forms are Important for Government?

Accessibility is a top priority for all government from federal to municipal. This is outlined in [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies). PDFs can be a hassle for users. Fillable PDFs don’t always function properly in every browser. Often times, PDFs require the user to print them out, hand-fill them in, and then scan them back in to City staff. They’re just not as accessible as online forms.

While we will still offer printable-versions of documents for those who don’t have computer access, the main documentation and process should be online to make processes as easy as possible for both the public and staff. PDFs are slow to load which is inconvenient for cell phone users who may pay for data.
