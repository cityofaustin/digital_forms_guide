# Make help and error messages actually help

If messages are not clear, they can frustrate residents and cause them to abandon a form altogether. 

* Don’t use help text to address shortcomings of a form. Strive to make the form as user-friendly and easy to understand as possible and minimize the amount of help text you even need. 
* Avoid having chunky, help paragraphs under each field. This starts to make the form look chaotic. Keep it concise.
* Make sure the help and error message is adjacent to the question it’s referencing so that the resident quickly sees it. Don’t make the user search for the message. 
* Make sure the error message appears in real-time. Don’t make the resident have try to go to a new page before they are alerted to an error.

* Make sure the error messages clearly tells the user what the error is and how to resolve it easily. 
* Use polite phrasing in error messages. Don’t blame the user by having messages like “illegal action.” 
* Use color, icons, and messages to clearly indicate an error has occurred. Just using one can leave the user lost or confused.
