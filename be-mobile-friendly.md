# Be mobile-friendly

* Minimize typing. Remember many residents are on mobile devices so create fields that reduce the amount of typing they must do. 
* Ask yourself if a question can be multiple choice instead of paragraph free-response?
* Make the fields match with the keyboard. If a resident has to enter numerical information, it should pull up that part of their keyboard.

* Use smart defaults and auto-fill.
  * Can the state be defaulted to Texas? 
  * Can you add an auto-detect option so they can select that for their location to save time? ****
