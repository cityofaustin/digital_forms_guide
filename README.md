# The City of Austin's Digital Forms Guide

## **Forms: The Front Door to the City**

Forms are often residents first interaction with the City online. It allows them to submit requests for information, leave comments and questions, apply for services, and more. 

No one loves filling out forms, which is why it is our job to make sure our forms are easy and quick for residents to use.  

This style guide provides City staff a living resource to support their creation of resident-oriented, easy to use, digital forms.

### Friends of Forms

Many thanks to the City of Austin team who came together to make this guide what it is today.
