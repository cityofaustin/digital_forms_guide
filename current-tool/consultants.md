# CTM Form Consultants Account Oversight

CTM Form Consultants also known as Admins, when creating forms...

* Please be sure to drag them to the appropriate department folder
* Archive any forms that you will not be using or created on accident
* Please give a title to all forms created - aftertime, having too many “Untitled Form” in the folders will become confusing and hard to manage.

### How do you manage user accounts?

* Keep accounts organized
* Maintain a list of who in the department has access
* Ensure that all users are using the system correctly
* Assist users with questions
* Share guidelines and policies \(link coming soon\) with users 
* Create forms for departments if necessary

### **Who needs an account?**

CTM Form Consultants will determine who needs an account by the frequency of forms that the department needs to build/update on a weekly/monthly basis.

### **Who needs a temporary account?** 

If Forms Creators only have one or two forms to create.

### **Who doesn’t need an account?**

A Forms Creator who only would be reviewing the data and a form requestor whose need is an app and not a form.
