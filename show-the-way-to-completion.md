  It’s important to guide the resident along the form journey, and give them
  confidence that they are on their way to completing the form.

# Show the way to completion

* On the start page, list the major sections so the resident has an idea of what they will encounter and have to complete in the form.

* Use completion timelines to let residents know where there are in the form at all times.

* Always have a button that allows the user to complete or continue the form, like “Submit” or “Next.”
* Avoid “Clear,” “Cancel,” and “Reset” buttons. This can frustrate user if they accidentally hit the button. 
* Use success messages to clearly communicate to the user when their form has been successfully submitted.
* Make sure the success message gives the user actionable next steps. Don’t take them to a dead end.
