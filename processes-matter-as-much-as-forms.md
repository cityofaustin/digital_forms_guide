# Processes matter as much as forms

However, what if your new form now only takes residents 1 minute to fill out, but your internal processes have not changed and it still takes your department 3 weeks to get back to the resident? 

You can have the greatest form ever created, but if your staff’s internal process to manage those forms is ineffective, then you’re still not providing the best experience for residents. 

End-to-end service

Make manual staff work go digital, too.
