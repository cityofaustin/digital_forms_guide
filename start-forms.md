# Starting out your forms

Build forms that have the most impact on the most residents or that without, could be life-threatening to residents. ****

* Title the form something clear so that the user knows exactly what they are filling out**.** 
* Create start pages to set expectations for users for the forms. 
  * Let the user know a time estimate for completion 
  * Be clear on documents and information they need to prepare to complete the form.
  * If they don’t need any preparation to complete the form, say “You won’t need to prepare anything to apply.” 
* On the start page, explain what will be required to complete the form and the process around the form.
* Avoid overwhelming residents with several-page, long start pages.
* Remember, not all forms need a start page or introduction. Always strive to make the fields in your form clear and simple enough to complete without the need for additional instructions.

* Add contact information on your form so that it appears on each page. If a resident has a question while completing the form, they have someone to reach out to.
* Avoid adding any items to the forms page that could be a distraction, such as promos and other design elements. Let the user focus on the task at hand.
